    <h2>Operations</h2>
    <p>
        this web application allows to access to a series of operations on the human genome<br>
        the operation view shows the dataset on which the operations are executed and below the
        series of operations that are active for the selected dataset<br>
        <a href="{{ url_for('active_operations', dataset_name = 'human_genome')}}">go to the operations>></a>
        <br>
        in order to change dataset you have to execute one of the filter operations
    </p>
    
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
        we extensively explain the software design, analysis and implementation<br>
        <a href="{{ url_for('documentation')}}">go to the documentation>></a>
        <br>
        this page shows the UML diagram of our software, the explanation of the relationships between
        the classes is underneath the diagram <br>
        underneath the software design explanation there is the software analysis.
        If you want to see the documentation of a specific class you can directly click on the 
        class square in the UML diagram and you will be redirected to the documentation of that specific class.
