This is the final project of the advanced programming course of the [Genomics](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/Genomics) bachelor degree - UniBo.

The project consists in a web application that is able to manipulate a GFF3 dataset ('Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.85.gff3.gz') that contains all of the features of the human genome.
