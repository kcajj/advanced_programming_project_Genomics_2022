# Advanced programming project - Genomics 2023
This is the final project of the advanced programming course of the [Genomics](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/Genomics) bachelor degree - UniBo.

The project consists in a web application that is able to manipulate a GFF3 dataset ('Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.85.gff3.gz') that contains all of the features of the human genome.

We followed the instructions provided by the Professor, you can find them [here](MarkdownFiles/Project_specification.md).

You can find the full project documentation in the "Documentation" page of the web application.

To run the web application on your browser:
1. Download the lastest release
2. Be sure to satisfy all of the requirements: python3, pandas library (1.4.2) and flask library (2.2.2)
3. Run the "main.py" file
4. Go to your [local host](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) (by default port 5000)
5. Enjoy
